# Relationship allowance assessments

Use this reference when investigating `06.free_float` or a relationship whose progress state affects its meaning. The assessment uses the same signed predecessor-working-time inverse calculation as the exported value. It holds the selected successor endpoint fixed, applies the configured lag operation, and reports hours divided by positive predecessor hours/day. It does not reschedule the project or certify P6 driving status.

## Progress and endpoint matrix

N means not started; A means active. Supported endpoint types are `TT_Task`, `TT_Rsrc`, `TT_Mile` and `TT_FinMile`. A numeric relationship with either endpoint `TT_Rsrc` is explicitly `Estimated`, using TASK-calendar movement; the exporter does not solve all assigned-resource calendars or resource constraints. Other supported numeric relationships are `Finite`. All numeric cases still require unambiguous identities, valid endpoints, calendars, HPD and lag evidence.

| Predecessor -> successor | Type and exported mode | Assessment basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N -> N | FS, SS, FF, SF | Existing remaining endpoint mapping; progressed mode is not required. |
| A -> N | FS, FF | Predecessor remaining finish to successor remaining start or finish. |
| A -> N or A | SF | `FixedEvent`: predecessor actual start cannot move with remaining work. |
| A -> N or A | SS, explicit ActualStart basis under Retained Logic/Progress Override | `FixedEvent`: predecessor actual start is fixed. |
| A -> N | SS, EarlyStart or unresolved basis | `RequiresContext`: remaining/internal SS scheduling context is unavailable. |
| N or A -> A | FS, Retained Logic | Predecessor remaining finish to successor explicit remaining restart. |
| N or A -> A | FF, Retained Logic | Predecessor remaining finish to successor explicit remaining finish. |
| N -> A | SF, Retained Logic | Remaining predecessor start to successor remaining finish; `CalculatedRetainedStartToFinish`. |
| N or A -> A | SS, except the fixed-actual-start case above | `RequiresContext`: no substitution of successor remaining restart for its actual start. |
| N or A -> A | FS, Progress Override, zero lag | Ignored only when the successor has a valid actual start on or before the project Data Date. |
| N or A -> A | Other Progress Override case, excluding fixed starts above | `RequiresContext`; no remaining lag or phase is invented. |
| N or A -> A | Actual Dates, excluding fixed SF start above | `RequiresContext` under this remaining displacement model. |
| Any completed endpoint | Any | Historical: actual events are fixed. |
| Unfinished WBS-summary endpoint | Any | `NoFiniteBound` / `IgnoredSummaryRelationship`; direct summary relationships are ignored. |
| Unfinished LOE endpoint | Any | `RequiresContext`; movement depends on its linked activity network. |

When a progressed mode is required but not exported, the outcome is missing data. A malformed or contradictory required value is invalid data. Missing/invalid endpoint evidence can prevent an otherwise supported case from calculating. The audit's selected endpoint fields identify the timestamps actually used; the normal 01/06 display date policy remains separate.

The exported `sched_retained_logic` / `sched_progress_override` flags select Retained Logic with Y/N, Progress Override with N/Y, and Actual Dates with N/N. Blank/absent flags do not imply N/N. The exported `sched_lag_early_start_flag` records EarlyStart for Y and ActualStart for N; Actual Dates reports this basis as not applicable. Every active endpoint requires a valid actual start and an unambiguous owning-project Data Date, including when only the predecessor is active. Actual start after an available remaining start/finish is `InvalidData` / `ActualStartAfterRemainingEndpoint`. Actual start after its Data Date instead returns `RequiresContext` / `ActualStartAfterDataDate`; it is not declared invalid under every P6 scheduling mode. These checks precede fixed-event/mode decisions. An actual finish on unfinished work or an actual start on unstarted work is `InvalidData` / `InconsistentActivityState`; a reversed remaining period is `InvalidData` / `ReversedRemainingPeriod`.

Treat the matrix as conditional coverage, not a replacement for assessment precedence. Explicitly ignored external settings (`sched_outer_depend_type=SD_None`) can establish `NoFiniteBound` / `IgnoredExternalRelationship`; otherwise progressed cross-project cases return `RequiresContext` / `UnverifiedMultiProjectProgressContext` before fixed-event interpretation. Matching project flags alone cannot establish the governing scheduling project. Historical and ignored-summary branches precede calendar/lag checks that are unnecessary for those outcomes; fixed-start cases also need no lag value to establish that the event cannot move. These labels do not certify all unused source fields as valid. The new Retained Logic N -> A SF allowance uses the successor's explicit remaining finish: changing its valid historical actual start while preserving chronology does not change the allowance.

## Reading an audit

`XerTransformer.AssessRelationships()` returns one assessment per raw TASKPRED row, including rows with no numeric allowance. The optional `XerToCsvConverter.RelationshipAudit.Cli` accepts repeated `--input` arguments and an explicit `--output <chosen-file.csv>`, with `--overwrite` for an existing audit target. The output parent folder must exist; no default filename is selected. Inputs remain ordered occurrences. Running an audit does not add normal CSVs, alter numbered schemas or extend review manifests.

The public `free_float_status` values are `Finite`, `Estimated`, `NoFiniteBound`, `Historical`, `FixedEvent`, `RequiresContext`, `MissingData` and `InvalidData`. Only `Finite` and `Estimated` carry a number; every other status leaves `free_float` blank. `NoFiniteBound` describes an ignored relationship and never serializes infinity or a large sentinel. `FixedEvent` distinguishes a valid actual start from a movable remaining endpoint. Zero is a real numeric result, not a substitute for any blank status.

Table 06 adds `free_float_status`, `free_float_basis` and `free_float_reason` immediately after `free_float`. The assessment API exposes these as `AllowanceStatus`, `CalculationBasis` and `ReasonCode`. Numeric bases are `TaskCalendarRemainingEndpoint`, `TaskCalendarSuspensionAdjusted`, `TaskCalendarResourceEstimate` and `TaskCalendarResourceEstimateSuspensionAdjusted`. Nonnumeric bases are `HistoricalActualEvent`, `FixedActualStart`, `IgnoredRelationship`, `UnresolvedContext` and `None` for missing/invalid evidence. Preserve the status, basis and reason with the number in reports.

The optional audit retains legacy classifications for compatibility:

| Public status | Legacy audit classification | Meaning of the blank or number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Finite` | `Calculated` | Numeric supported endpoint allowance. |
| `Estimated` | `Calculated` | Numeric TASK-calendar allowance involving a resource-dependent endpoint. |
| `NoFiniteBound` | `Ignored` | Blank: this ignored relationship imposes no finite bound of its own. |
| `Historical` | `Historical` | Blank: at least one endpoint activity is complete. |
| `FixedEvent` | `Unsupported` | Blank: the relevant predecessor actual start has already occurred. |
| `RequiresContext` | `Unsupported` | Blank: a scheduling rule, movement model or governing context is unresolved. |
| `MissingData` | `MissingData` | Blank: required source evidence is absent. |
| `InvalidData` | `InvalidData` | Blank: required evidence is malformed, ambiguous or contradictory. |

Use `ReasonCode` for grouping and `Message` for explanation. Preserve negative and subday values. Another successor, a constraint or a resource could still restrict the predecessor in a full scheduling run. A historical predecessor can impose a fixed release or unexpired lag; a blank movement allowance does not imply that the relationship has no scheduling effect.

Identify a row by its public source namespace and one-based source TASKPRED row ordinal, with the qualified relationship ID when available. Native relationship IDs and original filenames can repeat across inputs. The internal parser occurrence token is not a durable report key and is not exposed as an audit identity.

The optional audit schema is version 1.1 with 46 columns: version 1.0's provenance, assessment fields, scheduling-option raw/state pairs and `input_evidence`, plus `free_float_status` and `free_float_basis` immediately after `free_float`. The existing `reason_code` remains the audit reason field. Raw input evidence preserves field distinctions: `AbsentHeader` means that occurrence never exported the column; `OmittedCell` means its row ended before the column; `Blank` is an explicitly empty cell; `Present` retains a supplied value. Typed assessment can label an unusable supplied value `Malformed`. A later input's schema must not turn an earlier absent field into an explicit blank default. Inspect scheduling mode, lag-calendar/SS basis, Data Date, endpoints and HPD together with raw evidence. Import raw evidence as text.

Parsed-data callers can edit existing cells before assessment. Original field presence and raw text remain immutable evidence; evaluation uses the caller's current value for an originally present/blank cell. The audit adds `evaluation_value` and `evaluation_state` only when they differ from the original evidence. Audit evidence maps supplied values to `Valid`, or `Malformed` when a recognized typed field fails validation; untyped supplied text is also labelled `Valid`, not `Present`. That label is not proof that an untyped identifier resolves uniquely. The underlying parser still retains `Present` as its source-presence state. A padded or caller-created value cannot fabricate source evidence for an originally absent header or omitted cell. Distinguish raw source evidence from an explicit parsed-data edit when reconciling an audit.

Missing calendar identities produce `MissingData` with `UnresolvedPredecessorCalendar` or `UnresolvedLagCalendar`; a present calendar that cannot be resolved produces `InvalidData` with `InvalidPredecessorCalendar` or `InvalidLagCalendar` and its parse/inheritance failure. Nonzero lag with a missing setting is `MissingData`, while a malformed supplied setting or ambiguous options is `InvalidData`; both use `UnresolvedLagCalendarSetting`, so inspect classification and raw evidence together. A genuinely exported blank lag-calendar setting retains the successor-calendar default; absent headers and omitted cells do not.

A valid closed predecessor suspension removes `[suspend.Date, resume.Date)` from an immutable movement-calendar overlay used for working-time counting and inverse/forward movement. The independently configured lag calendar is unchanged, including `rcal_Predecessor`; the shared base calendar, other activities, shifts and inherited exceptions remain intact. A same-civil-day pair excludes no time and retains the ordinary basis, even if its intraday clocks are reversed. A valid nonempty interval selects the suspension-adjusted basis even when the calculated movement is zero or does not cross it. Recorded closed future intervals are usable; no additional suspension-before-Data-Date restriction is imposed.

Suspension requires an active `TT_Task` or `TT_Rsrc` predecessor and a suspend date on or after its actual-start date; otherwise the result is `InvalidData` / `InconsistentSuspensionState`. A missing suspend/resume bound gives `RequiresContext` / `UnresolvedSuspensionBounds`, including at zero movement. Malformed bounds or resume.Date before suspend.Date give `InvalidData` / `InvalidSuspensionBounds`. No resume date or zero allowance is invented. These checks apply to a candidate movable allowance; independently established historical, ignored or fixed-event outcomes do not require a movement overlay. This is an activity-specific movement calculation, not a reschedule.

Normal Standard Enhanced exports contain the selected numbered tables and `XER_DATA_QUALITY.csv`; raw-only exports do not acquire that companion. Programme 4.0 and Tender 3.0 retain their ten numbered tables and manifest (eleven files in total; `XER_DATA_QUALITY.csv` is not emitted in review bundles), with the expanded table 06 contract. Consumers must use the current profile's exact manifest/header contract; Tender 3.0 adds manual State metadata but does not change relationship arithmetic. Do not infer live Power BI/SharePoint validation or any LongestPathVisual change from an exporter test. Header-only table 06 retains the metadata columns; last-resort table recovery preserves available rows with blank float and `RequiresContext` / `UnresolvedContext` / `TableGenerationFailed`. Imported columns colliding with calculated metadata retain their evidence under collision-safe `raw_...` aliases. The companion reports affected fields and source evidence; the optional audit additionally records every successful relationship and its complete selected calculation basis. Review date-only columns cannot reconstruct intraday arithmetic.

## Evidence boundaries

Source reconciliation, synthetic forward-feasibility tests, file/stream equality, fixed-profile comparisons and a successful CLI run establish the implemented contract at the tested inputs. They do not certify native P6 scheduling parity, a browser-saved ZIP, report refresh or deployed UI behavior. Keep original XER files unchanged and local unless the user authorizes an upload. Do not change a report's least-float policy merely because a relationship is ignored, historical, unsupported or positive.
