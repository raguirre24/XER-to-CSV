# Export profiles and fixed contracts

Corrected implementation snapshot: 2026-09-06. Read actual headers rather than inferring profile from a table number or assuming an older build has these fixes. Field names/case below are intentional.

## Profile identity

| Property | Standard / legacy Enhanced | Programme Review | Tender Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Versioned report contract | None | 3.0 | 1.0 |
| Numbered tables | 01,02,03,04,06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15 when generated/selected | 01,02,03,06,07,08,09,10,12,15 | Same ten as Programme |
| 05 | Not defined | Not defined | Not defined |
| Manifest | None | XER_CSV_MANIFEST.csv | XER_CSV_MANIFEST.csv |
| Public key | `<public-source-namespace>.<native-id>`; ordinary unique filenames retain legacy keys | `CSV::<PROJECT>::<C-or-T>::<snapshot-tag>::<native-id>` | `CSV::<PROJECT>::TENDER::<yyyyMMdd-status-date>::<native-id>` |
| Original filename uniqueness | Repeated filenames/paths/hashes are valid in one ordered batch | Duplicate input filenames rejected | Repeated filenames, paths, hashes and native IDs across stages are valid |
| Source occurrence identity | Immutable per-occurrence token, separate from public namespace and original filename | Shared parser occurrence tokens; governed snapshot filenames remain distinct | Stable ordered internal source token; never key input collections by filename/path/hash |
| Boolean output | Usually 0/1 fields; raw XER flags also exist | Contract booleans `true` / `false` | Contract booleans `true` / `false` |
| Date output | Raw source dates and derived formats coexist | Fixed date fields `yyyy-MM-dd` | Fixed date fields `yyyy-MM-dd` |
| Table 10 | Raw CALENDAR plus keys/metadata | Key and name only | Key and name only |
| Table 15 grain | Assignment x actual/remaining x month | Assignment x actual/remaining x month | Task x resource x actual/remaining x month within stage/project |

Review profiles require source TASK, PROJECT, PROJWBS and CALENDAR. Their other six tables may be header-only when legitimately absent. Both profiles emit all ten fixed tables, the supplemental `XER_DATA_QUALITY.csv`, and a manifest: twelve files. The numbered schemas remain Programme 3.0 / Tender 1.0; the companion has its own `diagnostic_schema_version=1.0`. Standard emits the companion whenever table 15 is selected, alongside every requested valid table. The companion is header-only when clean, replacing stale warnings on a clean rerun. A requested missing source, unsupported table, invalid schema or unrecoverable calculation still rejects export before publication. An absent source is not the same as a present table with headers and zero rows.

Actual date problems with otherwise usable quantities, identities and calendars do not reject table 15: valid monthly and remaining allocations continue; unresolved actual units and unchanged source dates are reported in the companion. See the table dictionary for its exact fields and calculation rules for reconciliation. A successful export with warnings is not a declaration that the schedule is free of data-quality issues.

Programme project codes accept uppercase ASCII letters, digits and underscores; programme type is C or T. Programme also rejects duplicate source content. Tender codes accept uppercase ASCII letters and digits only and permits repeated content across distinct stages. Do not infer cross-profile identity by stripping punctuation.

### Internal identity versus report keys

The shared ordered parser assigns `SourceToken = <batch-GUID>:source-<six-digit-input-ordinal>`. This token remains unchanged for the parsed occurrence and is independent of filename, path and content hash. Its GUID is fresh per batch: it is not a persistent cross-run reporting key. Low-level parser calls also mint a fresh per-invocation token; they cannot silently share identity just because their filenames match. Tender binds parsed rows to its explicitly ordered governed stage tokens before calculations, including parsed-data entry points, without changing caller-owned rows. Shared calendar, task, relationship and resource lookups use the bound token; row copies retain it.

For Standard, `SourceFilename` is the public key namespace. A unique input keeps its trimmed original filename. Every colliding name receives a deterministic `#source-000001`-style suffix based on input order; an extra numeric suffix avoids collision with an unusual real filename already using that spelling. Matching/reservations are case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized. `OriginalSourceFilename` remains the supplied provenance for CSV `FileName` and filename-derived `MonthUpdate`. Consume the exported keys rather than recreating these namespaces in a report.

Inputs must remain an ordered sequence, including repeated occurrences. Independently parsed batches have distinct internal tokens, but merging batches with the same public namespace is rejected at Standard export: reparse those sources together so public keys can be allocated consistently. Do not fix that rejection by dropping repeated files. Tender's governed source-token/stage path remains independent of this Standard naming rule. Programme filters its resolved retained snapshots before calendar/resource calculations, including for parsed-data entry points; discarded snapshots do not participate in those calculations.

## Date and history meaning

Programme snapshots are Baseline (`BLnn`, optionally a suffix such as `BL01-A`) or Update (`YYMM`). The service resolves the retained baseline anchor and applicable updates before export; not every supplied file necessarily survives. Canonical filenames are `<PROJECT>-<C/T>-<TAG>_<yyyyMMdd-data-date>.xer`. `UpdateDate` is the effective report update date (update month-end for monthly updates); `data_date` comes from snapshot metadata and is validated against the project's P6 Data Date. Do not substitute one date for the other.

Programme history is matched across snapshots by project/activity business identity, not by the snapshot-qualified `task_id_key`. Previous activity values can refer to the previous observed snapshot containing that activity; `PreviousDataDate` follows project date history. Missing activity snapshots matter. History variances use the profile's weekday business rule, not task calendars; see calculation rules.

Tender canonical filenames are `<PROJECT>-TENDER-<yyyyMMdd-status-date>.xer`. `status_date` and `UpdateDate` are the selected stage status date. `data_date` and `monthupdate` are the independently read P6 `PROJECT.last_recalc_date`. `udf_datalake_status_date` reflects the selected status date; `add_date` is independent source project metadata. A status date must be unique per project within a bundle. Never collapse two stages because their hashes match. The source token protects parsing identity; the public namespace identifies the stage in reports.

Numbered review-table dates are date-only. They cannot reconstruct intraday relationship calculations or shifts; the parser uses timestamps before serialization. The diagnostic companion instead preserves source date strings, including timestamps and malformed values; import those diagnostic fields as text.

## Eight shared review table headers

```text
03_XER_PROJWBS:
wbs_name,wbs_id_key,parent_wbs_id_key,ProjectCode

06_XER_PREDECESSOR:
task_id_key,pred_type,predecessor_status_code,task_type,predecessor_task_type,lag,start,finish,predecessor_start,predecessor_finish,free_float,pred_task_id_key,status_code,total_float,task_pred_id_key,ProjectCode

07_XER_ACTVTYPE:
actv_code_type_id_key,actv_code_type

08_XER_ACTVCODE:
actv_code_id_key,actv_code_name,actv_code_type_id_key

09_XER_TASKACTV:
task_id_key,actv_code_id_key

10_XER_CALENDAR:
clndr_id_key,clndr_name

12_XER_RSRC:
rsrc_id_key,def_qty_per_hr

15_XER_RESOURCE_DISTRIBUTION:
task_id_key,rsrc_id_key,is_actual,distribution_month,monthly_quantity,rsrc_name,rsrc_type,unit,ProjectCode
```

`12.def_qty_per_hr` is text in the contract and represents a source default units/time rate, not earned units. Table 01 status labels are `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Complete`; relationship status fields in 06 retain raw `TK_*` codes. `pred_type` preserves the relationship type. Do not use one status-label filter on both tables.

## Manifests

Programme headers:

```text
schema_version,bundle_id,bundle_status,parser_version,project_code,project_name,programme_type,original_xer_filename,canonical_xer_filename,snapshot_kind,snapshot_tag,monthupdate,update_date,data_date,source_sha256,table_name,row_count,csv_sha256,exported_at_utc
```

Tender headers:

```text
schema_version,bundle_profile,bundle_id,bundle_status,parser_version,project_code,project_name,original_xer_filename,canonical_xer_filename,status_date,update_date,data_date,source_sha256,table_name,row_count,csv_sha256,exported_at_utc
```

Programme completion literal remains `complete`; Tender uses `COMPLETE` and `bundle_profile=tender_review`. These indicate completed publication, not absence of warnings. Manifest rows describe each retained snapshot/stage and each exported table, including `table_name=XER_DATA_QUALITY`: eleven manifest rows per retained source. The companion's per-source row count is its warning count; its hash is validated like numbered CSVs. Validate the declared version/profile, source-stage coverage, row counts at the declared source/table grain, and CSV hashes against actual files. Consumers hard-coded to eleven bundle files or ten manifest rows per source must accept the approved supplemental artifact; numbered report columns have not changed. A CSV hash can repeat for the same combined table across manifest source rows; it does not make those source rows duplicates. Do not assemble one export from files belonging to different bundles or attach old files to a new manifest. Independently validated bundles can coexist in a comparison model when profile/bundle/scenario provenance remains explicit; public keys can recur across successive bundles, so do not accidentally join or sum duplicate snapshots across them.
